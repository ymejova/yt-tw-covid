YouTube links on Twitter around the onset of COVID-19

This project contains aggregated data derived from a dataset of YouTube links shared on Twitter from June 2019 to September 2020, capturing the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. 

## Daily volume by country

In daily_volume folder, you can find three files, measuring different aspects of the data: number of posts, number of unique users, and number of unique videos, shared on that day in a country. The country is determined using GeoNames mapping of the Twitter user Location field.

## Daily volume and mobility plots

The folder plots_users_mobility contains plots of the unique users time series, as well as mobility data (from [Apple Mobility Trends](https://covid19.apple.com/mobility) report) and lockdown dates (from [Oxford's Coronavirus Government response tracker](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker)).
